**Hostile's Land** will be the default gamemode. A blend between extraction and survival. It is round based, determined by each **Red Crow Storm**.

**[[Red Crow Storm]]** occurs every 8 to 12 minutes, extraction points are open short before the storm. The storm does 10hp damage per second unless players are inside and near a campfire or extracted.

**Extraction** allows players to save items for next run and earn **Krits** which is the currency beyond the gamemode. Certain missions requires players to extract with particular items to complete.

**Infilling** is getting deployed into the map, you can infill with a loadout, but dying means you will likely lose your infilled items.

**Dying** will drop all your items on your character and infilled items. You can retrieve your items if you find your deathpack.
