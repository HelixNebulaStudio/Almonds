# Hunger & Thirst
Natural hunger and thirst can still be satiated by normal eatible items but it will only be filled to a temporary maximum and you are put on eating cooldown with the Temporarily Full debuff.

# Feast Deployables

A Feast is a deployable which contains a bunch of food cooked together. After placing it, it will be deployed for a duration. The feast is consumed only after the duration.

Interacting with the feast for a short duration will fill your calories and hydration bar. You will also gain a Full meal buff when both your hunger and thirst is full, Full Meal buff will last for some minutes and while the buff is active, your hunger and thirst will not decrease.

The full meal buff also contains special attributes that boost your character based on the ingredients in the meal.

The output of a feast is calculated by the division of ingredients so mixing the right amout of ingredients helps you in ways you want.

# Ingredients
Based on different ingredients, different feasts will be made. Different feast has different benefits.

To gamify this mechanic, the ingredient color will naturally correspond to the effects and outcome of a feast. The design choice is to make cooking self explanatory as oppose to realistic.
