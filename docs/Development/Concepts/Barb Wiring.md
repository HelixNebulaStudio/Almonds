**Barb Wiring** `barbwiring` will be a tool that lets you draw barb wires on surfaces to create lines of barb wiring across floors and walls which will prevent building near them.

Since the `cupboard` only prevents building and picking up deployables inside the foundation of a shelter, the barbwiring will be the item to prevent others from placing ladders or other deployables on your shelter's external walls.
