Contracts are short tasks that are located around the map as a military radio. Activating a contract gives you a mission that spawns certain items or entities. These contracts are repeatable and only exist within your runs. Only one contract can be active at a time per person.

## Military Radios
Located around the map, players can claim a contract from it. Once claimed, it will be deemed as active to anyone who interacts with it. Once completed, the military radio will no longer be activatable.

These radios are marked on the map with the type of contract.
## Contracts
Potential contract types are:

- Scavenge
- Deliver
- Eliminate
- Stronghold

### Scavenge
Scavenge contract will generally require you to search for an item in different areas. Some might circle an area on your map while another will tell you a specific location to search. You may have to pick up a cache tracker for certian contracts.

### Deliver
Bringing an item from one point to another. You may be revealed on the map to other players near radio stations. 

### Eliminate
A special npc spawns in a nearby area and you have to kill them. Regardless of who and how the target is killed, it will still count. Target may also be a destructible instead of a npc.

### Strongholds
Strongholds are shelters which are highly fortified. You are given a key to unlock a door in order to wipe the hostiles within them.
